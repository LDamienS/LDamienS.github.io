            <p id="about-p"> My name is Damien and I am a student
                at the University of Rhode Island. I am
                majoring in computer engineering and
                minoring in computer science. I will hopefully be graduating in 2025.
            </p>
            <p id="about2-p"> I was born in 2003 and grew up as a Steelers fan. I also enjoy basketball, however
                I don't exactly have a favorite team. If I had to pick a team it would probably be the celtics.
                I value family and friendship and an ideal day would be spending it with them. Being happy 
                is a great thing and it is easy to be happy when you're surrounded by great people and the 
                Steelers are winning games.
              </p>
